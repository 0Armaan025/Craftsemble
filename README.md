## Hey all, if you are reading this, you are amazing! ‚≠ê
## **Craftsemble** is a project made for the Hanko Hackathon using [Hanko](https://hanko.io) providing an amazing authentication service.
## This is not really a project, but an AIM, a mission!
## Artisans/Craftsmen usually don't get the respect they truly deserve, and I thought to get on a journey to prepare a solution, Hanko provided with an amazing opportunity, [The Hanko Hackathon](https://hanko.io/hackathon).
## The project is made in **ReactJS, HTML, CSS, JS, and Firebase have been used**.
## It includes some basic features that serve a mission like:
- Blogs
- Exhibition
- Profile
- Dashboard
- Badges system/Hall of Fame
- Group messaging
- Virtual drawing
- Workshops and much more! ;)

It can be tested out here on [Craftsemble](https://www.craftsemble.co)

# ADDITIONAL INFO

Since I'm a student, I was unable to have proper time to develop this, I had to be awake till midnight, or sometimes even 5 am in the morning, all that with managing studies and festivals.
